								<p>Israel, a Middle Eastern country on the Mediterranean Sea, is regarded by Jews, Christians and Muslims as the biblical Holy Land. Its most sacred sites are in Jerusalem. Within its Old City, the Temple Mount complex includes the Dome of the Rock shrine, the historic Western Wall, Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Israel's financial hub, Tel Aviv, is known for its Bauhaus architecture and beaches. To the north lie Nazareth and the freshwater Sea of Galilee, important New Testament sites in the life of Jesus. Haifa offers vistas from Mount Carmel and manicured, terraced gardens. Down the coast are the ruins of Caesarea, King Herod’s Roman port. The 1st-century-B.C. clifftop fortress Masada overlooks the Dead Sea, known for its spas and mineral-heavy water. In the south, hiking trails cross the Negev Desert. At the southern tip, Eilat is a Red Sea resort with coral reefs and high-rise hotels.</p>

							<h3>Transportation</h3>
							<p>Transportation is quite complex but there are a few ways to get around:</p>
							<h4>From & To Airport</h4>
							<h5>Taxis</h5>
							<p>
								At the arrival hall, follow the signs for the taxi area. It is on the left as you exit the terminal
								building behind the exit for the train station. There is a steward who can assist you with any questions.
								The price for the trip to Tel Aviv is fixed. Give the steward your destination and he will confirm the
								price, It should be about NIS 150-170 (about £38-45 or $42-48) depending on the number or persons
								and luggage. Make sure your driver is aware that you have been given a price before starting your
								journey.
							</p>
							<h5>Train</h5>
							<p>
								The trains in Israel can be quite complicated and unpredictable. 
								However the train from the airport is quite comfortable and can get you to several central stations on the outskirts of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. 
								Tickets can be bought at the automated terminals at the entrance to the train station accessible from the terminal hall.
							</p>
							<h5>Rental</h5>
							<p>
									Parking and traffic can be a real challenge in Israel. If you have a rental, we recommend to use parking garages when possible.
							</p>
							<h4>Inside the City</h4>
							<h5><a target="_blank" href="https://gett.com/">Gett</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://uber.com/">Uber</a></h5>
							<h6><span class="icon fa-info-circle"></span> Make sure the taxi uses the meter and there's no need to tip.</h6>
							<p>
								If you plan to use taxis to get around in Tel Aviv, we recommend you download Gett
								on your phone. Uber now also works the same way: you will be able to book through
								Uber a normal taxi.
								You can also hail a taxi on the street or ask your hotel or restaurant to book one for
								you. 
							</p>
							<h5><a target="_blank" href="https://www.li.me/">Lime</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bird.co/">Bird</a></h5>
							<h6><span class="icon fa-info-circle"></span> Be careful, bike lanes are not well established, and so you'll need to ride on the road and sometimes even the sidewalk.</h6>
							<p>As you walk around the city, you'll probably notice the electric scooters passing you by. As cities in Israel are quite small and flat, renting one these could be a great solution for a quick trip to the beach.</p>
							<h3>Dress Code</h3>
							<h4>Day to Day</h4>
							<p>Simply put, there isn't one! It's too damn hot anyways. Just dress lightly and make sure you have something long with you for visiting holy sites and some chilly evenings.</p>
							<h4>For The Wedding</h4>
							<p>
								Israeli weddings are casual. 
								You can dress up or down as you prefer. Just know it will be warm and we will be dancing!
								Men tend to wear a nice pair of jeans or slacks with a button shirt, sometimes a jacket but no ties.
								Women often wear a dress or slacks with a nice shirt. In this case it will be June so something light is best.
							</p>
							<h3>Communications</h3>
							<h3>WiFi</h3>
							<p>There is wi-fi almost everywhere you go. In malls, in coffee shops, in hotels and Airbnbs.</p>
							<h3>Local SIM Card</h3>
							<p>Since Israel is not part of the european union your mobile plan won't work. We recommend that you buy an Israeli sim card at the airport if you do not want to incur excessive carrier and Internet costs. </p>
							<h3>Finance</h3>
							<h4>Payments</h4>							
							<p>
									Markets and local places might only accept cash.
									It's a good idea to bring cash that you can exchange at any exchange office in the city.
									Yoy can also use your debit card to take cash in the local currency straight from an ATM. 
									If you have a credit card that is good for abroad transactions and doesn't charge a fee every time you use it, then you can use credit cards in lots of places. 
									The local currency is New Israeli Shekels (ILS) or "Shekels" for short.
							</p>
							<h4>Tipping</h4>
							<p>
								Tipping in Israel is usually between 10%-20%. 
								Tips must be left in cash, as there is no option to add a tip to your card after paying a bill. 
								No need to tip cab drivers.
